# MANET_Datasets

This is a collection of MANET benchmark datasets.

## CONTACT 
(http:// konect. cc/ files/ downl oad. tsv. conta ct. tar. bz2): This dataset records an undirected human
contact network. The trace records all contact information and data transfer between a group of users who
carry wireless devices at various locations. In the dataset, a node represents a user; an edge between two
users means that there is a contact between two proximate devices.

## HYCCUPS 
(https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-upbhyccups): This dataset is collected from trace of wireless
contacts and usersâ€™ connections at the Politehnica University of Bucharest in the period from March to May
2012. 72 participants used an Android application named HYCCUPS Tracer to collect mobile interaction
information in the background. It records sensor data and connectivity information between smart devices
and other wireless access devices based on AllJoyn framework.

## ASTURIESER 
(https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-oviedoasturies-er): The
dataset comprises mobility traces and connectivity information of around 229 vehicles and helicopters in
the regional Fire Department of Asturias, Spain, collected over one year. The datacenter collects devices
current positions, status, contacts, etc., every 30 s. The threshold of communication distance between different
devices is 10 m, 50 m or 200 m.

## ROTAXI 
(https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-epflmobility):
This dataset contains mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, USA. It contains GPS coordinates of approximately 500 taxis collected over 30 days in the San Francisco Bay Area.
