# MANET_Datasets

This is a collection of MANET benchmark datasets.

## CONTACT 
(http:// konect. cc/ files/ downl oad. tsv. conta ct. tar. bz2): This dataset records an undirected human
contact network. The trace records all contact information and data transfer between a group of users who
carry wireless devices at various locations. In the dataset, a node represents a user; an edge between two
users means that there is a contact between two proximate devices.

## HYCCUPS 
(https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-upbhyccups): This dataset is collected from trace of wireless
contacts and usersâ€™ connections at the Politehnica University of Bucharest in the period from March to May
2012. 72 participants used an Android application named HYCCUPS Tracer to collect mobile interaction
information in the background. It records sensor data and connectivity information between smart devices
and other wireless access devices based on AllJoyn framework.

## ASTURIESER 
(https://c rawda d.o rg//d ownlo ad/o viedo/a sturi es-e r/a sturi es-e r-1 year-m obili ty.c sv.g z): The
dataset comprises mobility traces and connectivity information of around 229 vehicles and helicopters in
the regional Fire Department of Asturias, Spain, collected over one year. The datacenter collects devices
current positions, status, contacts, etc., every 30 s. The threshold of communication distance between different
devices is 10 m, 50 m or 200 m.

## ROTAXI 
(https:// crawd ad. org// downl oad/ roma/ taxi/ taxi_ febru ary. tar. gz): This dataset is derived from
the real motion traces from approximately 320 taxis with GPS devices in Roma, Italy, for the duration of
one month. Each taxi driver uses the location manager software based on GPS to retrieve longitude and
latitude coordinates of current location periodically. The dataset also records time duration, speed, status,
and contact information among devices.
